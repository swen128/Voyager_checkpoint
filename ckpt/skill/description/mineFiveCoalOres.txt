async function mineFiveCoalOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 coal ores using either a stone_pickaxe or an iron_pickaxe. It first checks if there are 5 coal ores nearby. If not, it explores the environment until 5 coal ores are found. Once 5 coal ores are found, it mines them using the pickaxe and saves the event of mining 5 coal ores.
