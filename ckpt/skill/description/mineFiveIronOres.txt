async function mineFiveIronOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 iron ore blocks using a stone pickaxe or better. First, check if the bot has a stone pickaxe or better in its inventory.

If not enough iron ore blocks are found nearby, explore until 5 iron ore blocks are found. Finally, mine the 5 iron ore blocks using the stone pickaxe or better.
