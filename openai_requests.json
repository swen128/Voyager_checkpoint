Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided.

You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Additionally, you may also find some animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens.\n\nQuestion 2: What are the items that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The items that can be found in a grove in Minecraft depend on the specific type of grove. However, some common items that can be found in various types of groves include oak trees, birch trees, flowers, tall grass, and mushrooms. Additionally, some groves may contain unique items such as berry bushes or sweet berry bushes in the taiga biome.\n\nQuestion 3: What are the mobs that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the grove in Minecraft are usually passive mobs such as rabbits, chickens, and cows. However, it is also possible for hostile mobs such as zombies and skeletons to spawn in the grove during the night or in dark areas.\n\nQuestion 4: How can you use coal to your advantage?\nAnswer: Coal is a very useful resource in Minecraft. It can be used as fuel for furnaces, which can smelt ores and cook food. Coal can also be crafted into torches, which provide light in dark areas and prevent mobs from spawning. Additionally, coal can be used to craft blocks of coal, which can be used as a more efficient fuel source for furnaces.\n\nQuestion 5: What are the benefits of using an iron pickaxe over a stone pickaxe?\nAnswer: An iron pickaxe is more durable and can mine harder materials such as gold, diamond, and emerald ore.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

                "message": "Question 1: What are the blocks that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The blocks that you can find in the grove in Minecraft may vary depending on the biome, but typically you can find grass blocks, dirt blocks, oak trees, flowers, and tall grass. Additionally, you may also find some animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens.\n\nQuestion 2: What are the items that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The items that can be found in a grove in Minecraft depend on the specific type of grove. However, some common items that can be found in various types of groves include oak trees, birch trees, flowers, tall grass, and mushrooms. Additionally, some groves may contain unique items such as berry bushes or sweet berry bushes in the taiga biome.\n\nQuestion 3: What are the mobs that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the grove in Minecraft are usually passive mobs such as rabbits, chickens, and cows. However, it is also possible for hostile mobs such as zombies and skeletons to spawn in the grove during the night or in dark areas.\n\nQuestion 4: What are the resources that you can find in the grove biome?\nAnswer: The grove biome in Minecraft is a relatively new biome that was added in the Caves and Cliffs update. It is a lush and vibrant biome that is home to a variety of new plant life, including azalea bushes, flowering azalea bushes, and spore blossoms. As for resources, players can find copper ore, clay, and coal in this biome. Additionally, axolotls can spawn in water sources within the grove biome.\n\nQuestion 5: How can you use coal in Minecraft?\nAnswer: Coal is a very useful resource in Minecraft. It can be used as a fuel source for furnaces, allowing you to smelt ores and cook food. Coal can also be crafted into torches, which provide light in dark areas. Additionally, coal can be used to create blocks of coal, which can be used as a longer-lasting fuel source for furnaces.\n\nTime: day\n\nNearby blocks: stone, coal_ore, iron_ore, dirt, emerald_ore, snow_block, snow\n\nOther blocks that are recently seen: gravel\n\nNearby entities: None\n\nHealth: 20.0/20\n\nHunger: 20.0/20\n\nPosition: x=11.4, y=144.0, z=-17.5\n\nEquipment: [None, 'iron_chestplate', None, None, 'iron_pickaxe', None]\n\nInventory (14/36): {'cobblestone': 38, 'coal': 10, 'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'spruce_planks': 3, 'stick': 1, 'iron_sword': 1, 'stone_pickaxe': 3, 'crafting_table': 1, 'iron_pickaxe': 1, 'furnace': 1, 'spruce_sapling': 1, 'dirt': 5}\n\nChests: None\n\nCompleted tasks so far: Mine 1 wood log, Mine 3 more spruce logs, Craft a crafting table, Craft a wooden pickaxe, Mine 1 iron ore, Craft a furnace, Place the furnace, Smelt 1 raw iron, Mine 3 coal ores, Craft an iron pickaxe, Mine 5 iron ores, Craft an iron sword, Smelt 5 raw iron, Craft an iron chestplate, Equip the iron chestplate, Mine 5 coal ores\n\nFailed tasks that are too hard: None\n\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

(xx/36): ...\nChests: ...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

                "message": "Question 1: What are the blocks that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The blocks that you can find in the grove in Minecraft may vary depending on the biome, but typically you can find grass blocks, dirt blocks, oak trees, flowers, and tall grass. Additionally, you may also find some animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens.\n\nQuestion 2: What are the items that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The items that can be found in a grove in Minecraft depend on the specific type of grove. However, some common items that can be found in various types of groves include oak trees, birch trees, flowers, tall grass, and mushrooms. Additionally, some groves may contain unique items such as berry bushes or sweet berry bushes in the taiga biome.\n\nQuestion 3: What are the mobs that I can find in the grove in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the grove in Minecraft are usually passive mobs such as rabbits, chickens, and cows. However, it is also possible for hostile mobs such as zombies and skeletons to spawn in the grove during the night or in dark areas.\n\nQuestion 4: What are the resources that you can find in the grove biome?\nAnswer: The grove biome in Minecraft is a relatively new biome that was added in the Caves and Cliffs update. It is a lush and vibrant biome that is home to a variety of new plant life, including azalea bushes, flowering azalea bushes, and spore blossoms. As for resources, players can find copper ore, clay, and coal in this biome. Additionally, axolotls can spawn in water sources within the grove biome.\n\nQuestion 5: How can you defend yourself against a creeper?\nAnswer: The best way to defend yourself against a creeper is to attack it from a distance with a bow and arrow or other ranged weapon. If you don't have a ranged weapon, you can try to lure the creeper away from you by running in the opposite direction. If the creeper gets too close, you can try to hit it with a sword or other melee weapon, but be careful not to get too close or it will explode and cause damage to you and your surroundings.\n\nBiome: grove\n\nTime: noon\n\nNearby blocks: stone, dirt, snow_block, snow, iron_ore, coal_ore, emerald_ore, spruce_leaves, spruce_log\n\nOther blocks that are recently seen: None\n\nNearby entities: zombie, creeper\n\nHealth: 20.0/20\n\nHunger: 19.0/20\n\nPosition: x=30.6, y=140.0, z=-14.5\n\nEquipment: [None, 'iron_chestplate', None, None, 'crafting_table', None]\n\nInventory (19/36): {'spruce_sapling': 1, 'stone_sword': 1, 'coal': 9, 'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'spruce_planks': 9, 'cobblestone': 134, 'stone_pickaxe': 3, 'raw_iron': 2, 'shield': 1, 'iron_sword': 1, 'iron_pickaxe': 1, 'crafting_table': 1, 'furnace': 1, 'dirt': 3, 'emerald': 5}\n\nChests: None\n\nCompleted tasks so far: Mine 1 wood log, Mine 3 more spruce logs, Craft a crafting table, Craft a wooden pickaxe, Mine 1 iron ore, Craft a furnace, Place the furnace, Smelt 1 raw iron, Mine 3 coal ores, Craft an iron pickaxe, Mine 5 iron ores, Craft an iron sword, Smelt 5 raw iron, Craft an iron chestplate, Equip the iron chestplate, Mine 5 coal ores, Mine 1 emerald ore, Mine 3 emerald ores, Craft a shield, Craft a stone sword\n\nFailed tasks that are too hard: None\n\n",

missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

Additionally, players may also find coal ore, iron ore, and copper ore in this biome.\n\nQuestion 2: What are the items that I can find in the jagged peaks in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The jagged peaks biome in Minecraft is known for having a lot of exposed stone and ores, including coal, iron, gold, and even diamonds. You may also find emeralds in this biome. Additionally, you may come across various types of flowers, grasses, and trees.\n\nQuestion 3: What are the mobs that I can find in the jagged peaks in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the jagged peaks biome in Minecraft are goats and strays.\n\nQuestion 4: What are the mobs that I can find in the jagged peaks in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the jagged peaks biome in Minecraft are goats and strays.\n\nQuestion 5: How can you use a shield to protect yourself from attacks?\nAnswer: To use a shield in Minecraft, you need to hold it in your off-hand slot (the one on the left side of your inventory). When you are attacked, right-click with the shield to block the attack. The shield will reduce the amount of damage you take and can also block certain types of attacks, such as arrows and fireballs.

respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

Additionally, players may also find coal ore, iron ore, and copper ore in this biome.\n\nQuestion 2: What are the items that I can find in the jagged peaks in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The jagged peaks biome in Minecraft is known for having a lot of exposed stone and ores, including coal, iron, gold, and even diamonds. You may also find emeralds in this biome. Additionally, you may come across various types of flowers, grasses, and trees.\n\nQuestion 3: What are the mobs that I can find in the jagged peaks in Minecraft?\nAnswer: The mobs that can be found in the jagged peaks biome in Minecraft are goats and strays.\n\nQuestion 4: How can you protect yourself from fall damage while exploring the jagged peaks biome?\nAnswer: You can protect yourself from fall damage while exploring the jagged peaks biome by using elytra, which is a pair of wings that allow you to glide through the air. You can also use a water bucket to create a pool of water at the bottom of a fall, which will break your fall and prevent damage. Additionally, you can use feather falling enchantment on your boots to reduce fall damage.\n\nQuestion 5: What are the resources that can be found in the jagged peaks biome?\nAnswer: The Jagged Peaks biome is not a naturally occurring biome in Minecraft. It is likely a custom biome added by a mod or a datapack. Therefore, the resources that can be found in this biome would depend on the specific mod or datapack that added it.\n\nNearby blocks: stone, snow_block, snow, crafting_table\n\nNearby entities: None\n\nHealth: 20.0/20\n\nHunger: 20.0/20\n\nPosition: x=32.5, y=188.0, z=-47.5\n\nEquipment: [None, 'iron_chestplate', None, None, None, None]\n\nInventory (22/36): {'iron_sword': 1, 'stone_sword': 1, 'coal': 9, 'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'spruce_planks': 5, 'stone_pickaxe': 5, 'stick': 2, 'raw_iron': 2, 'shield': 1, 'cobblestone': 136, 'stone_axe': 1, 'spruce_sapling': 1, 'iron_pickaxe': 1, 'furnace': 1, 'dirt': 3, 'emerald': 5}\n\nChests: None\n\nCompleted tasks so far: Mine 1 wood log, Mine 3 more spruce logs, Craft a crafting table, Craft a wooden pickaxe, Mine 1 iron ore, Craft a furnace, Place the furnace, Smelt 1 raw iron, Mine 3 coal ores, Craft an iron pickaxe, Mine 5 iron ores, Craft an iron sword, Smelt 5 raw iron, Craft an iron chestplate, Equip the iron chestplate, Mine 5 coal ores, Mine 1 emerald ore, Mine 3 emerald ores, Craft a shield, Craft a stone sword, Craft 1 stone_pickaxe, Craft 1 stone axe\n\nFailed tasks that are too hard: None\n\n",

(xx/36): ...\nChests: ...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided.

applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks.

each round of conversation, I will give you\nCode from the last round: ...\nExecution error: ...\nChat log: ...\nBiome: ...\nTime: ...\nNearby blocks: ...\nNearby entities (nearest to farthest):\nHealth: ...\nHunger: ...\nPosition: ...\nEquipment: ...\nInventory (xx/36): ...\nChests: ...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Additionally, copper ingots can be used in the crafting recipe for the new item bundle, which allows players to store multiple items in one inventory slot.\n\nBiome: old_growth_spruce_taiga\n\nNearby blocks: stone, dirt, andesite, copper_ore, coal_ore, grass_block\n\nOther blocks that are recently seen: None\n\nHealth: 20.0/20\n\nHunger: 20.0/20\n\nPosition: x=502.5, y=74.3, z=307.5\n\nEquipment: [None, 'iron_chestplate', None, None, 'dirt', 'shield']\n\nInventory (32/36): {'stone_sword': 1, 'moss_block': 4, 'coal': 15, 'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'spruce_planks': 3, 'stone_pickaxe': 5, 'snowball': 27, 'raw_iron': 2, 'spruce_sapling': 2, 'stone_axe': 1, 'andesite': 9, 'diorite': 1, 'raw_gold': 1, 'azalea': 1, 'cobblestone': 95, 'stick': 2, 'stone_hoe': 1, 'copper_ingot': 12, 'chest': 1, 'stone_shovel': 1, 'iron_sword': 1, 'crafting_table': 1, 'iron_pickaxe': 1, 'dirt': 2, 'furnace': 2, 'emerald': 5}\n\nChests: None\n\nCompleted tasks so far: Mine 1 wood log, Mine 3 more spruce logs, Craft a crafting table, Craft a wooden pickaxe, Mine 1 iron ore, Craft a furnace, Place the furnace, Smelt 1 raw iron, Mine 3 coal ores, Craft an iron pickaxe, Mine 5 iron ores, Craft an iron sword, Smelt 5 raw iron, Craft an iron chestplate, Equip the iron chestplate, Mine 5 coal ores, Mine 1 emerald ore, Mine 3 emerald ores, Craft a shield, Craft a stone sword, Craft 1 stone_pickaxe, Craft 1 stone axe, Craft 1 stone shovel, Mine 1 gold ore, Kill 1 tropical_fish, Craft 1 stone hoe, Mine 3 copper ores, Equip the shield, Smelt 12 raw copper\n\nFailed tasks that are too hard: Cook 1 tropical fish, Cook 1 tropical fish, Cook 1 tropical fish\n\n",

...\nHunger: ...\nPosition: ...\nEquipment: ...\nInventory (xx/36): ...\nChests: ...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nHunger: ...\nPosition: ...\nEquipment: ...\nInventory (xx/36): ...\nChests: ...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

There also might be some unknown chest, you should ask me to open and check items inside the unknown chest.\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current learning progress.\n2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what mobs I need to kill.\n3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as \"Mine [quantity] [block]\", \"Craft [quantity] [item]\", \"Smelt [quantity] [item]\", \"Kill [quantity] [mob]\", \"Cook [quantity] [food]\", \"Equip [item]\" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.\n4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.\n5) The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.\n6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.\n7) Do not ask me to build or dig shelter even if it's at night. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.\n8) Tasks that require information beyond the player's status to verify should be avoided. For instance, \"Placing 4 torches\" and \"Dig a 2x1x2 hole\" are not ideal since they require visual confirmation from the screen. All the placing, building, planting, and trading tasks should be avoided. Do not propose task starting with these keywords.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.\nTask: The next task.\n\nHere's an example response:\nReasoning: The inventory is empty now, chop down a tree to get some wood.\nTask: Obtain a wood log.",

The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Mine the copper ore blocks with your pickaxe to collect them. Each block will drop one copper ore.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nExplain: ...\nPlan:\n1) ...\n2) ...\n3) ...\n...\nCode:\n```javascript\n// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)\n...\n// main function after the helper functions\nasync function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",

...\nTask: ...\nContext: ...\nCritique: ...\n\nYou should then respond to me with\nExplain (if applicable): Are there any steps missing in your plan? Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.\n    6) Call `bot.chat` to show the intermediate progress.\n    7) Use `exploreUntil(bot, direction, maxDistance, callback)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs.

Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly.\n        - Use `craftItem(bot, name, count)` to craft items. Do not use `bot.craft` or `bot.recipesFor` directly.\n        - Use `smeltItem(bot, name count)` to smelt items. Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable.
